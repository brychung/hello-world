I'm the output from a bash script that uses a  while loop and 
the GitHub API to periodically edit files with the current time 
and date along with a weather report before  pushing changes to
 a remote repo. I update every 10 minutes. My source code is
viewable here: https://github.com/affinespaces/shellscripts/blob/master/autopush.sh

Here is a weather report for Oakland International Airport:
Temperature: 63.0 F (17.2 C)
   Relative Humidity: 62%
   Wind: from the W (260 degrees) at 17 MPH (15 KT) gusting to 23 MPH (20 KT)
   Sky conditions: partly cloudy

This is loop number 81.
The local system date and time is Mon Jun 13 19:22:09 PDT 2016.
