Here is a weather report for Oakland International Airport:
Temperature: 59.0 F (15.0 C)
   Relative Humidity: 74%
   Wind: from the W (280 degrees) at 10 MPH (9 KT)
   Sky conditions: overcast

This is loop number 1.
The local system date and time is Mon Jun 13 05:28:31 PDT 2016.

I'm the output from a bash script that uses
a while loop and the GitHub API to periodically 
edit files with the current time and date along
with a weather report before pushing changes to a 
remote repo.
