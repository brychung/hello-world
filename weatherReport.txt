I'm the output from a bash script that uses a  while loop and 
the GitHub API to periodically edit files with the current time 
and date along with a weather report before  pushing changes to
 a remote repo. I update every 10 minutes. My source code is
viewable here: https://github.com/affinespaces/shellscripts/blob/master/autopush.sh

Here is a weather report for Oakland International Airport:
Temperature: 66.0 F (18.9 C)
   Relative Humidity: 54%
   Wind: from the W (270 degrees) at 14 MPH (12 KT)
   Sky conditions: mostly clear

This is loop number 65.
The local system date and time is Mon Jun 13 16:39:56 PDT 2016.
