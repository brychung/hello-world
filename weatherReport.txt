I'm the output from a bash script that uses a  while loop and 
the GitHub API to periodically edit files with the current time 
and date along with a weather report before  pushing changes to
 a remote repo. I update every 10 minutes. My source code is
viewable here: https://github.com/affinespaces/shellscripts/blob/master/autopush.sh

Here is a weather report for Oakland International Airport:
Temperature: 63.0 F (17.2 C)
   Relative Humidity: 60%
   Wind: from the W (260 degrees) at 16 MPH (14 KT)
   Sky conditions: mostly clear

This is loop number 34.
The local system date and time is Mon Jun 13 11:25:19 PDT 2016.
