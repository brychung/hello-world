I'm the output from a bash script that uses a  while loop and 
the GitHub API to periodically edit files with the current time 
and date along with a weather report before  pushing changes to
 a remote repo. I update every 10 minutes. My source code is
viewable here: https://github.com/affinespaces/shellscripts/blob/master/autopush.sh

Here is a weather report for Oakland International Airport:

   Relative Humidity: 52%
   Wind: from the W (270 degrees) at 20 MPH (17 KT) gusting to 24 MPH (21 KT)
   Sky conditions: mostly clear

This is loop number 61.
The local system date and time is Mon Jun 13 15:59:21 PDT 2016.
