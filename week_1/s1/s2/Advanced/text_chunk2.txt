Lily (My One and Only) -- Smashing Pumpkins 
 
Lily, my one and only 
I can hardly wait till I see her 
Silly, I know I'm silly 
Cause I'm hanging in this tree 
In the hopes that she will catch a glimpse of me 
And thru her window shade 
I watch her shadow move 
I wonder if she.......? 
 
Lily, my one and only 
Love is in my heart and in your eyes 
Will she or won't she want him 
No one knows for sure 
But an officer is knocking at my door 
 
And thru her window shade 
I watch her shadow move 
I wonder if she could only see me? 
 
And when I'm with her I feel fine 
If I could kiss her I wouldn't mind the time it took to find 
 
My lily, my one and only 
I can hardly wait till I see her 
Oh lily, I know you love me 
Cause as they're draggin me away 
I swear I saw her raise her hand and wave (goodbye)
