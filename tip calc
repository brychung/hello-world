0.2.1 1. Tip Calculator
Below, you can see the script we wrote to compute the tip for a meal. Fix it so that it works correctly. Save
your result as the le tip.py.
In [ ]: price = input("Enter the price of a meal:")
tip = price * 0.16
total = price + tip
print("A 16% tip would be ", tip)
print("The total including tip would be ", total)

#I have some notes below of questions I had during the code to make it better (more python-y)
