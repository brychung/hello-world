cd ..lion and $82.4 billion, but some market watchers are unsure if Apple will top the record 74.5 million iPhones it sold in the year-ago quarter, due to perceived lower iPhone 6s sales.

iPhone 6s sales concerns might be more evident in Q2 2016, however, as Apple's newest products and services, including the Apple Watch, Apple Music and the new Apple TV, coupled with the busy holiday shopping season, fuel projections that Apple will again report the most profitable holiday quarter in not only the iPhone maker's nearly 40-year history, but of any company ever.

Apple's guidance is between $75.5 billion and $77.5 billion in quarterly revenue, while the consensus among professional analysts is around $76.5 billion.

﻿Second commit! No crazy Rick and Morty quotes this time:

Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,

The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.

I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"

N.Spell-POEM(continued as promised)
…Touching your face with my hand  -
I can feel your every thought.
Being with you in the coldest day 
keeps me safe and warm:
There, in your arms
Melting like a wax,
Feeling all in love, as never before…
Here, are these words
coming onto the surface of my mind,
reaching out for you.
You are invited into my dreams,
in a place with no time and space,
without all constraints of my visible world.
You will be like a kiss of a wind on my skin:
Always with me – wherever I go.
Fading away into the thin air,
You can be my mirage in a desert heat:
peaceful mirror-surfaced mountain lake
Or a furious forest fire-
Whatever you are – loved and admired..
Changing like a weather on a derelict planet,
… You will never fail to surprise me!
Everlasting, evanescent and illusive…
Here, in my heart,
 With my every sigh -
Opening this door into the world-
we will never be apart any more ,
Feeling all alive – together- 
 …as never before…!

From Typing the command “import this” into Python:

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
