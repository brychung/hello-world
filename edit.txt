 "Educators, generals, dieticians, psychologists, and parents
  program. Armies, students, and some societies are programmed.
  An assault on large problems employs a succession of programs,
  most of which spring into existence en route. These programs
  are rife with issues that appear to be particular to the
  problem at hand. To appreciate programming as an intellectual
  activity in its own right you must turn to computer programming;
  you must read and write computer programs -- many of them.
  It doesn't matter much what the programs are about or what
  applications they serve. What does matter is how well they perform
  and how smoothly they fit with other programs in the creation of
  still greater programs. The programmer must seek perfection of
  part and adequacy of collection.
    Our traffic with the subject matter of this book involves us
  with three foci of phenomena: the human mind, collections of
  computer programs, and the computer. Every computer program is a
  model, hatched in the mind, of a real or mental process. These
  processes, arising from human experience and thought, are huge
  in number, intricate in detail, and at any time only partially
  understood. They are modeled to our permanent satisfaction rarely
  by our computer programs. Thus even though our programs are
  carefully handcrafted discrete collections of symbols, mosaics
  of interlocking functions, they continually evolve: we change
  them as our perception of the model deepens, enlarges, generalizes
  until the model ultimately attains a metastable place within
  still another model with which we struggle. The source of
  exhileration associated with computer programming is the
  continual unfolding within the mind and on the computer of
  mechanisms expressed as programs and the explosion of perception
  they generate. If art interprets our dreams, the computer executes
  them in the guise of programs!"
  -- Abelson & Sussman, SICP 

 "Mathematics presented as a closed, linearly ordered,
  system of truths without reference to origin and purpose
  has its charm and satisfies a philosophical need. But the
  attitude of introverted science is unsuitable for students
  who seek intellectual independence rather than indoctrination;
  disregard for applications and intuition leads to isolation
  and atrophy of  mathematics. It seems extremely important
  that students and instructors  should be protected from smug
  purism."
  -- Richard Courant, Introduction to Calculus and Analysis

…Touching your face with my hand  -
I can feel your every thought.
Being with you in the coldest day 
keeps me safe and warm:
There, in your arms
Melting like a wax,
Feeling all in love, as never before…
Here, are these words
coming onto the surface of my mind,
reaching out for you.
You are invited into my dreams,
in a place with no time and space,
without all constraints of my visible world.
You will be like a kiss of a wind on my skin:
Always with me – wherever I go.
Fading away into the thin air,
You can be my mirage in a desert heat:
peaceful mirror-surfaced mountain lake
Or a furious forest fire-
Whatever you are – loved and admired..
Changing like a weather on a derelict planet,
… You will never fail to surprise me!
Everlasting, evanescent and illusive…
Here, in my heart,
 With my every sigh -
Opening this door into the world-
we will never be apart any more ,
Feeling all alive – together- 
 …as never before…!

Melting like a wax,
Feeling all in love, as never before…
Here, are these words

reaching out for you.
You are invited into my dreams,
in a place with no time and space,
without all constraints of my visible world.
You will be like a kiss of a wind on my skin:
Always with me – wherever I go.
Fading away into the thin air,
You can be my mirage in a desert heat:
peaceful mirror-surfaced mountain lake
Or a furious forest fire-
Whatever you are – loved and admired..
Changing like a weather on a derelict planet,
… You will never fail to surprise me!
Everlasting, evanescent and illusive…
Here, in my heart,
 With my every sigh -
Opening this door into the world-
we will never be apart any more ,
Feeling all alive – together-

Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.

There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.

Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
