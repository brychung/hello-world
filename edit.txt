This is me(Maya), editing your file!
This is me again, this time from the command line.

Hi Everyone. This is Ankith
If I'm understanding the assignment correctly, I'm supposed to create this file, since there is not an existing version
here in the playground

It's 33 degrees Fahrenheit in New York today.

Editing the file again since my last check in is missing!

The weather today in Mountain View, CA is 49 degrees and sunny. Yay!

The goal for today is to put as many "force push" memes on the wall as possible.  - Jay

Don’t ask me what you know is true. Don't have to tell me...

One final edit for the road.

This is Scott and I totally just edited this. I initially tried to fork, then clone/edit/commit/push but then I wasn't sure how to get from my fork back to the live location. This is attempt #2 after having cloned the playground directly without forking. Seriously, no forking around. - 1/21/2016

OK OK .. I am giving it a shot from Milan Italy. -1°C i.e 30 Fahrenheit .. No forking here

Wohoo! hope I got this right -EY

Finally! I hope this works-Priya

For those of you using Terminal on a Mac, Silver Aerogel is the setting you want. Thank me later -PJ

Major snowstorm this weekend - freezing from East Coast

This is dan wald's entry.  On sunday, I plan to fix capitalization to this line and add a weather update.  I have been having trouble operating git from the command line.  It is a clear and cool night out of Manhattan Beach, CA.  Sorry, East Coast...
