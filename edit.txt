Aaron's first comment here! - 1/20/2016

This is me(Maya), editing your file!
This is me again, this time from the command line.

Hi Everyone. This is Ankith
If I'm understanding the assignment correctly, I'm supposed to create this file, since there is not an existing version
here in the playground

It's 33 degrees Fahrenheit in New York today.

Editing the file again since my last check in is missing!

The weather today in Mountain View, CA is 49 degrees and sunny. Yay!

The goal for today is to put as many "force push" memes on the wall as possible.  - Jay

Don’t ask me what you know is true. Don't have to tell me...

This is Scott and I totally just edited this. I initially tried to fork, then clone/edit/commit/push but then I wasn't sure how to get from my fork back to the live location. This is attempt #2 after having cloned the playground directly without forking. Seriously, no forking around. - 1/21/2016

OK OK .. I am giving it a shot from Milan Italy. -1°C i.e 30 Fahrenheit .. No forking here

Wohoo! hope I got this right -EY

Finally! I hope this works-Priya

For those of you using Terminal on a Mac, Silver Aerogel is the setting you want. Thank me later -PJ

Raining in south Florida today - 1/22/2016 - AP

Major snowstorm this weekend - freezing from East Coast

This is Dan Wald's entry.  On Sunday, I plan to fix capitalization to this line and add a weather update.  I have been having trouble operating git from the command line.  It is a clear and cool night out of Manhattan Beach, CA.  Sorry, East Coast...
I am having no problem with git when using commands inside a single repository, but the upstream and origin alias is not working correctly yet.  I plan to wipe and start over.

Capitalization fixed.  I'm having an ok time using git on babun, git bash is somehow harder?  I'm also having issues with upstream vs. origin.  I think I will start over from scratch later this week :(

One more change :) Goodluck on the hw!

hmmmm....let me see something
 Hi this is Sandip - my first edit to this file. 

****
Part of me wants to overwrite everyone's changes.  But that would make me the playground bully, wouldn't it?

This is Sandip again - to clarify, above line was not my comment :-)

Reminder there is a W18 slack channel in the mids group

This is Lana's second commit/push.

This is Laura trying my first commit/push. I didn’t fork first, I have no idea if that matters or not. I’ll figure that out soon enough.

I’m back -EY

took me sooooooo long to set up github...testing adding something to the edit.txt file
Now testing out something else
trying something again
Does anybody know why it added my first line ('testing adding something to the edit.txt file') to someone else's existing line?

Hello from the command line. -A Dell
THIS IS HOW WE DO IT

I found this good git guide: http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/
No idea if it all is valid, but so far it has helped me!
